## Dashboard Overview  
### 1. Key Metrics  
- **Total Calls Received**: Displays the total number of calls handled over a specific period.  
- **Average Call Duration**: Shows the average time spent on each call.  
- **Average Response Time**: Indicates the percentage of calls handled within or below the service level agreement (SLA).  

### 2. Call Analytics  
- **Total Calls by Reason**: Categorizes calls based on customer queries, including billing questions, service outages, and payments.  
- **Total Calls by Sentiment**: Breaks down customer sentiment into very positive, positive, neutral, negative, and very negative.  
- **Call Duration by Reason**: Displays the average time taken for different call types.  
- **Call Duration by Sentiment**: Analyzes call durations based on customer sentiment.  

### 3. Geographic Distribution  
- **Calls by Channel**: Visualizes the number of calls received from different locations, such as London, Glasgow, Liverpool, Birmingham, and Manchester.  

## Key Findings  
1. **High Call Volume for Billing Queries**  
   - The majority of calls (23K) are related to billing issues, significantly higher than service outages and payment-related queries (5K each).  
   - This indicates a need for improved billing processes or better customer education regarding billing inquiries.

2. **Sentiment Analysis Shows Negative Trends**  
   - A substantial number of calls are categorized as **negative (11.06K)** and **very negative (6.03K)**, while fewer calls reflect positive sentiment.  
   - This suggests potential dissatisfaction among customers, which should be addressed through service improvements or better customer support strategies.

3. **Call Duration is Relatively Consistent Across Reasons**  
   - Average call durations for different reasons (Billing, Payments, and Service Outages) are close to each other, ranging between **24.97 to 25.19 minutes**.  
   - Despite different call reasons, handling times remain similar, which could indicate standardized issue resolution processes.

4. **Response Time Needs Improvement**  
   - Only **75.26% of calls are handled within or below SLA**, meaning nearly **25% of calls exceed SLA limits**.  
   - This highlights a need for improved response times, possibly through better staffing, training, or process automation.

5. **Call Distribution is Even Across Cities**  
   - Call volume is **evenly distributed across major cities** (London, Glasgow, Liverpool, Birmingham, and Manchester, each handling 6.59K calls).  
   - This indicates a balanced demand across regions, allowing for better regional support planning.

## Tools Used:  
- **Power BI**: Data visualization and dashboard creation.  
- **DAX**: Custom measures and calculations for in-depth analysis.
